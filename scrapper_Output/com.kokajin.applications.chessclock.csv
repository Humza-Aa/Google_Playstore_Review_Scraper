com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Victor Chibwe,I never expected to find a quality clock like this one. This is the best chess clock I've ever come across!,5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Arpan Kodali,nice chess clock app,5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Stefano Fiorani,"This app seems very good; nice and clean. Since I'm not planning to use this clock for chess, but for a different game (i.e. Hive), it would be very nice, albeit totally superfluous, to have the option to show near the timers, short hexagonal prisms instead of kings. I know I can disable the chess icons if they end up bothering me too much, I just thought, since it looks like you encourage feedback from your users, that you would like to hear me out. Bye bye. <3",5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Aldi Gozali,I tried at least three different chess timer apps and this one is so far the best. The app meets my expectations which are it has the sound of time-end. It also has asymmetrical time setting. It's also able to display the view in landscape.,5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,StvRdhll,Very nice app. Very flexible. I use it for backgammon matches. Suggest more colour options on settings.,4
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Vinay Khemka,Good and excellent,5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Ayden Thomas Chan,So far my experience is good just reseting the clock does have an ad overall not a bad chess clock!,4
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Franz Schmidt,Best chess clock - especially for teaching learners new to competitive play.,5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Gennady Duchovich,"One stop shop for a virtual chess clock. It covers everything you can wish for and is superior in my opinion, here is why: - Colour schemes - Predefined timer templates - Various types of clocks from classic to FIDE - Setting different times per player - Showing kings and player names - All features are free, but I paid a small fee anyways to remove a few ads and give deserved credit to developer for their efforts. Kudos!",5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,B Dee,Simply Good,5

com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,sreekanth Kc,Simply beautiful app,5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Edward Klages,The only thing that prevented a 5 star rating is that I could find no way to set the FIDE mode to two stages instead of three. Everything else was great.,4
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Richard Albury,Great chess timer. My only issue is I do not see a way to exit the app.,4

com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,AboveU,"Best chess clock i've downloaded, it's built for modern android too and has the most customizability compared to other clocks. Edit: Only complaint is the inability to name presets or add notes to them, I like to have different time presets for different opponents so it would be appreciated.",4

com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Marble Smar,Amazing app!! Better than most.,5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,CBplayZ,"Easily the best digital chess clock I've ever used. It is *not* close. For one; none of the other clocks I've tried have had the FIDE stage format. This app not only has it, but it's customizable! From the amount of time you get in each stage, to what move each new stage begins on (the increment is also still customizable in the FIDE formatting). And on the topic of increment, none of the other clocks I've tried have had delay as a secondary option! There's more but I'm out of space. It's great.",5

com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Jesse Grondahl,"All in all I like it. So far it's the only chess clock I've found with an hourglass format. However, I think you should be able to handicap using differential increments and/or delays instead of just differential time.",4

com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,George Papaioannou,Practically all the needed features are present.,5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Finn Grant,"I'm giving this 5 stars mainly because it has hourglass mode :) none of the main / most popular apps I've tried do. I didn't realise this was even a time format many people play, but it makes so much sense for causal players who don't know whether their game will turn into an interesting educational game which needs a long time to finish, or a pretty boring one where the clock is too long, and one player will get bored while the other wastes time pointlessly.",5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Sonu dutta ARUP Dutta,Outstanding performance 💯💯👌👌,5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Vivek Raut,My experience was really good. Just a doubt how do set up increment after 60 moves if i am setting up an armageddon game. Do resolve this issue,4

com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Kevin P Glynn,Beautifully simple clean yet customisable chess clock. The response and feedback of the tapping of your colour to put the clock onto your opponents is very good. Suitable for 30min style games and speed chess.,5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Simon Daniel,Sorry for 1 star. This was the best app but then you started using ads(I can understand you also need money to survive).

Amazing app. Has many features like colour change, font for clock, diplay king colour, display name, show tenths of a second( I found this feature only in this chess clock), statistics, add time increment( like +1min for the other if someone plays an illegal move) and many more. Loved it. If the design is bit more professionalised,(like slimming down the time bar) then this app would be perfect!

com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,Sendo Mendo,"The most perfect clock in the store. I have one suggestion for simplicity, in the option ""Low time warning"" I suggest it to be in minutes and seconds instead of percentage, and this sound should be played once because if there is an increament in time control the sound maybe played again and again and become annoying.",4

A must have for on the go chess.",5
com.kokajin.applications.chessclock,A Google user,I downloaded hundreds of chess clock apps in playstore but I found this one the best among the best. If you accidentally hit the home button of your phone the time automatically pause and when the timer says 0 its really 0 meaning youre out of time and they really countdown. Other chess clock app they consider both of you has 0 time. The feature I mentioned above are absent in some other chess clock app. You can try others but this is the BEAST CHESS CLOCK APP EVER!,5
