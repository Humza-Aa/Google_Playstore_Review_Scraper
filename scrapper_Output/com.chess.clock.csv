com.chess.clock,Lasse Adriansen,This Chess timer is really solid I prefer it's layout to most others on the app store. But it does lack one feature which I think is pretty key which is asymmetrical timers. I often play against less experienced players and like using asymmetrical timers to make play more balanced. Because of this I have to turn to other timers like the Magnus Chess Timer despite preferring this one. Other than that I think it's a great app and hope they'll add the few features it's missing to make it perfect,4

This allow each player to have a move time of 1:30 minutes that is reset automatically. Would be better if the color of the timer could switch from Orange to RED for the player that finished the time.

com.chess.clock,A Google user,Marvelous by all standards,5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,"When the time runs out timer turns red and by pressing on it, asks you to reset the clock. This is bad because if players don't see that the time has run out the game continues. The clock shouldn't warn you that the time has run out.",2
com.chess.clock,A Google user,But I dos'nt,5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,"Great chess clock app. You can change the delay settings on the clock, nice feature. One problem as mentioned by others I can't delete old individual clock profiles.",4
com.chess.clock,A Google user,"Please add the interface preferences, and the ""clicking"" sound every move. The clicking just occur in a few opening steps, and gone... kinda throw the hype away of the game, especially the thrill of bullet. And the last one it didn't have compared by the other apps, a handicap feature.. I can't seem to find any option for a handicapped match, which is to set each player's time differently. After this all set and done, I'll give 5 stars",3

com.chess.clock,A Google user,"I can't seem to figure out how to delete settings. I think it should be the button at the top, next to the button to create profiles, but I can't select any settings to either delete or edit. Furthermore, I am actually looking for a setting that gives me an x amount of time per turn. The closest I could get with this app was either Fischer or setting a delay (but then I can't see how much time I spent on the turn).",3

com.chess.clock,A Google user,SUPER,5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,There's no choices to change my view to make it both face the players instead of only facing the individual player. Nevermind... I just had to rotate my phone.. Sorry!,5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,Different times for different players. I'd love to give my son a time advantage on blitz. I see some others have requested this. Its very common to do this with real clocks between uneven players. Thanks!,3
com.chess.clock,A Google user,"This app can't even do what a real chess timer can do and thats change yhe settings.   I shouldn't have to go in and set up multiple game profiles to just modify a time setting.   It says I can delete stuff but the function is broken.  Kinda lame.  Further more, chess clocks are used for more than just chess, I couldn't give a load about the various speed chess styles.",2

com.chess.clock,A Google user,But Need different times setting for players,5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,"You can't edit saved settings at all and worse you can't delete them. Otherwise good interface, easy to use, better than the other ones around.",3
com.chess.clock,A Google user,"Tournament TC requires 30/75, then G/45 delay 30 (second stage); in this app it appears that the delay can only be set in the first stage regardless of number of stages in customized mode.",4

com.chess.clock,A Google user,"It's the best of over 200 chess clock apps i checked out. Jst one thing though, an icon to indicate who is black n who is white should be added to the time boxes. Really great app!",5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,"You can't even choose your time and one clock is off of time, it does not even show number of moves",3
com.chess.clock,A Google user,allah khuda hai,5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,The clock rounds the time to seconds in stead of keeping the exact time (without having to display it). This clock fails as a clock.,1

Clock face is simple and unadorned. Just click the live clock to switch. When the live clock face goes red, the game's over. No adverts, no data mining and it's free. How can anyone not give it five stars?",5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,Very good,5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,"I have one suggestion though: maybe add an Hourglass clock mode? In Hourglass chess, each player starts out with only e.g. 30 seconds total time, but while your clock runs DOWN during your turn, your opponent's runs UP (and visa versa). So, the faster you make your moves, the less extra time you grant your opponent.",5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,Its very important for chess player,5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,Very nice,5
com.chess.clock,A Google user,I requested few improvements. One of them is most important different time for individual player and also number of moves. I think the app developer made the app and forgot to come back and check it.,1
com.chess.clock,A Google user,No issues ever.,4
com.chess.clock,A Google user,"May have just been me, but I couldnt find a way to edit/remove customized settings. Would like to be able to change times/rename/remove the nondefault time controls. Uninstalled and reinstalled to work around. Otherwise very clean, would also like a little count down for the delay times instead of no feedback to just wait until your time goes down",3
