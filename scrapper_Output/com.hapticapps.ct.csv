com.hapticapps.ct,Swapnil P,"Update: The current version is PATHETIC. It is laggy, has an comfortable UI layout, stuggles for connectivity & feels like a data harvester. There was no need to change the original layout. Developer(s) should fix it and stop ruining the game. Original review for earlier versions: Nicely designed game. Has almost everything that a chess game should have. Only 2 features are missing. 1. Option to favorite or 'star' a specific match. 2. An indicator to show if we did chatting in a game or not.",2

com.hapticapps.ct,David Reece,"Great app, lots of cool features! Multiplayer is fun and can be very competitive. Probably one of my favourite chess apps atm. Very very small amount of ads, 1 at the end of a match or so already better then most apps who constantly make you watch 30 seconds videos. Premium features aren't forced on you and you can still do everything without premium features.

com.hapticapps.ct,Jake,Great game but would be good to have the option to disable chat as a setting (perhaps other than preset pleasantries) - more and more juvenile idiots seem to be playing and the constant trash talk is pretty tedious.

com.hapticapps.ct,In God We Trust,"I just went back to review a couple past games and found out that the ""game history"" section only goes back a certain number of games. The games I wanted to review were completely erased. This is sad because I was very proud of one game which is now gone, so I no longer can show anyone. The other game had a very important conversation to me, which, along with the game, is now erased. It's a good app, but be sure to record your moves after every game. You can't count on game history to show them.",3
