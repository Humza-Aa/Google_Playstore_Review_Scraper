com.chess,Nguy·ªÖn Minh ƒê·∫°t,Game l·ªói,1
com.chess,Joe Richey,"I have a very dull and bitter taste in my mouth currently. Twice now, in the middle of a game, my game window just disappeared (on mobile). I lost both games to abandonment. There is no option or area in the GUI to find your game and rejoin the game. It seems as though this site is plagued by cheating players as well. To many times wierd and nonhuman moves are made. It seems all lower ranking players are playing a higher than 95% game. Uninstalling this garbage",2
com.chess,Goggy55,amazing app,5
com.chess,John Trezise,"good app, can play by your self or on line",5
com.chess,Abraham Manuel,"There are something wrong with this app. I was playing now but some how the game jamed and the opponent timer was running the the reached to 00:00, i went to my profile the wasn't showed who won. I was some times going to win but suddenly it resignd me auto. I will unistall for good. Like someone cheating the results. This is awefull",1
com.chess,Abhirup Mondal,I am rating it 5 star but recently i am having facing a problem of matchmaking and it showing no network connect even though i have full network services thank you,5
com.chess,Nitin Navgane,Best platform to practice,5
com.chess,Roy Loh,"The connectivity is absolute trash, I've lost multiple games as a result of sudden disconnections, even on 5G.",1
com.chess,Zain ul Abdin Rajput,Very bad server connectivity. I have lost many times because the game disconnects even though my internet is working completely fine. Terrible experience.,1
com.chess,Aris kolivas,Very bad app. I have a winning position and all of the sudden i get the auto-resign and lost the match. In 5 games i got it 2 times and lost the matches i should have won. And of course the piece tab doesn't goes off in every move so i make moves I never wanted to make. Terrible.,1
com.chess,raju boppani,very fast in connecting games,5
com.chess,PRIYTAM KUMAR,"I love this app, it's definitely the one if you want to play challenging game. Kudo to the team and thanks a ton for making this app. Only thing I would like to request to provide some incentives to best performer like free subscription, more Puzzle etc. If someone wins 3 or 10 matches in a row, Or keep their score/ranking above 1k( it could be anything). This will definately make playing more engaging.",4
com.chess,Rhayan Job Bautista,"Its not responding as normal right now it was saying that i have a low internet connection but when i checked my speed connection in my phone it was fine,this has caused me 100 rating points so please fix this,its driving me mad on every time it happens",2
com.chess,Wanted Gm Productions,"Unfortunately there's just to many random bugs. Connection drops for no reason, the app launching new games when you open the app, that end up costing to much Elo to make the risk off using the app worth it. Just stick to the browser version.",2

com.chess,Hardik Makvana,Not able to chat and low connection.,1

com.chess,Joel Cerva,easy to use,4
com.chess,Alex Zerbea,"good game but I dont like that it signals when your queen is in danger because then other players are forced to move it and then you won't be able to punish them for mistakes, and it doesn't have unlimited reviews of your game which sucks but other than that it's an amazing game and its really fun.",4
com.chess,Nicolas Silva,"Easy to misclick on mobile, maybe add a mode to confirm move before committing to the move",4

com.chess,James H,"Game will not register your moves for seconds, even on wifi. If you play with smaller time limits, this will loose you games.",3
com.chess,John Gittins,I'm often kicked out of games for poor connection no matter wether I'm using data or WiFi. So annoying as it auto resigns and I lose points for no reason. Wouldn't be fussed if I wasn't a premium member but I am so feels like this is a bit of a basic problem that shouldn't be happening.,2

com.chess,dyzqy,pretty cool,5
com.chess,Michael Basezzi,bravi,5
com.chess,Martin H-E,"Frustrating. Largely OKish but a number of niggling issues. The app ranks me at around 450-600 in 10min chess. It matches you to players of a similar rank. However, these players are often bots that the app pretends are real players. This is obvious because they use book moves well, and play the piece immediately. The monthly subscription provides only 1 game review a day, and is poor: ie '8 blunders' in a 1 minute win with 85% accuracy & no pieces lost. Go figure. The training is also v poor.",1
com.chess,Augustine Consult,"Excellent app. I enjoy my chess anywhere, anytime and everywhere.",4

com.chess,VoD00 2085,Interface is garbage. Controls are unresponsive. You make a move and nothing happening wasting time. And they want money to use any of the features free on lichess. The only people who say this app is better are people who are paid to say that or people with cost sunk falacy.,1

com.chess,Joey Mitchell,The learning puzzles are few and useless unless you pay the subscription. Why pay a subscription for tips you can get on youtube for free? Also the controls are unstable and sometimes my queen turns sentient and moves to get herself killed without me touching the screen. This has happened to me multiple times.,1
com.chess,Steak Dinner,the only downside is they constantly ask for your information to sell you on their premium version that's like 150 bucks a year.,5
com.chess,Project Abash,Switching to lichess. This app is impossible to use after the update. The bottom of my phone glows blue and next thing u know I'm at 2fps always at the end of a game. I cannot play like this. I'm out. DONE. FIRE THE DEVS IMMEDIATELY.,1

com.chess,Mazen Harake,"I would say it is reasonablly closed of to casuals that don't want premium features except the game analysis limit of 1 per day is a bit too little, maybe 3 would be better.

It shouldn't even be a recurring charge, but I get that we live in a greedy world now and there's no such thing as generous corporations anymore. So if you're going to be greedy and make it monthly, it shouldn't be more than $1 a month.",2

com.chess,KevMc29,Excellent app whether a beginner or experienced player. The lessons are perfect to help beginners learn the game and there are really good puzzles to help you think outside the box and get a better grasp of in-game tactics. Definitely recommend. One minor thing I'd like to see introduced is the flag of your opponent added to the recent game list. More for interest than anything,5

com.chess,Oluwadare Matthews,"Taken my time to observe a kind of discrimation in your scoring. Most time I win it's either a 6, 7 or 8, and rarely a 9; but whenever I lose its mostly a 9 to my opponents. I don't want to start associating regions or colour to it. I am watching closely. Another observation is the scoring system. It's poor. It presumes its own move preference is the best, whereas in chess, strategy is unlimited. Your app scores a great win low because it didn't follow your algorithm. Is chess so restrictive?",1

com.chess,Matthew Lor,It's chess. Fun games. Puzzles are mediocre. It insists that opponents will move in a certain manner but not all the moves are forced moves so the hints make little to no sense. The Knights always move first. No repercussions for queuing for a game and auto aborting because someone is lower ranked. Should be at least a few points and counts as loss. Otherwise it takes forever to climb.,2

An example of this might be something like moving your bishop back 2 spaces to the right but end up moving forward 2 spaces to the left.

com.chess,Mikey Teen,"Such a money grab compared to lichess. They basically try to make every feature they can require premium. To analyze games, play puzzles, and much more. Not as intuitive as lichess (analyzing a game is surprisingly hard and doesn't make the best move very obvious). It's quite buggy; premoves are not instant (which they should be) and will still cause you to lose time (I lost a game even though I was playing with premoves the whole time, but I was still losing time).

This is a position it can not be taken from. Twice the oppositions pawn has taken my piece and moved from e4 to d3. This has ruined two close games that I had a chance to win in. I am now in cheque and will lose an important playing piece, basically costing me the game",4

com.chess,Zak ‚ÄúZakery‚Äù Feasey,Worst chess app going. They pair mobile vs pc when pc has a massive benefit in premoves. Delete your highlight after a move is made. Don't account for any latency.

No one new to chess would keep playing like this. These draws are not by stalemate or repetition, or lack of pieces.",2

Only hardworking players can understand the agony of studying for hundreds of hours to improve your game, playing a one hour classic game against an inaccurately higher rated opponent and getting disconnected in the endgame when you're three pieces up and you are bound to deliver checkmate in a few moves. Oh the agony!üò´",1

com.chess,Andrej Zupanƒçiƒç,"The app is very good: five-star stuff. But one aspect of UI was bothering me. Namely, it often reacts erratically to your on-board chess moves when you use the ""draw"" technique, dropping the pieces on a wrong square (resulting in a mistake and an automatic subtraction of ELO points - and there is nothing you can do about it). Same with ""tap"" technique. The developer, however, promptly replied and pointed out the way around this problem. Perhaps, this could be furter improved by software updates?",4

Game isn't oven and even if it was I would have been the clear victor as it was impossible for them to get a checkmate.",3

It only shows what you did wrong, and no longer what you should have done.

com.chess,RONALDINHO Messi,Best chess app there is,5
com.chess,Adam Lopez,"Seems like a good app at first but gets disappointing quick. Players play common lines repeatedly which I don't know if that is what the app lessons teach. However, it makes for an uneventful game. Then when you do play better players, there is a lot of poor sportsmanship. Than of course there is the situation when you click on a piece and you change your mind on moving that piece, so when you click on the side to disengage the piece from moving, it still moves... Its frustrating if anything.",1

com.chess,priyanka halloon,"Chess develops the ability to see from someone else's perspective. Skilled chess players learn to anticipate an opponent's next moves. To predict what another person will do next, a player must develop the ability to adopt another person's perspective and infer what action they are likely to take . And Chess is a board game played between two players. It is sometimes called Western chess or international chess to distinguish. I can see all this feature in this game a nice game please download",5
com.chess,Bhushan Abhyankar,The app is amazing... User Interface and overall interaction is great! The only problem seems to be this bug which is messing up the complete game. A pawn sometimes deliberately moves only one square to change the dynamics even if I have selected two squares for it to move from initial position. Not sure if this is done to not move game twords locking defense posture but it is pretty annoying. It hampers the winning positions and happens unexpected. Please take a look at this,4

I understand that courses are not free and that this app needs money for further development etc. but at least puzzles should be completely free in my opinion (like lichess)",3

Only 1 game analysis per day is allowed and the analysis board is limited to depth 10 unless you pay whereas Lichess offers unlimited analysis and unlimited depth for free. The clock cant be moved unlike on Lichess so it is hidden by your hand during games if right handed. Games played against the computer dont get archived ect...,1

Peopel do the ""technique"" where they have two phones, in one theyre playing online and in the other theyre playing with an BOT and copy every move that it does.

So many features you don't even need to pay or have an account for, and it's not hyper aggressive with ads like most free apps. Causing literally no disruption. Just a heads up, some AI opponents need patience and experience. I also suggest looking at pros if you want to get better and looking at different styles and formations. They are vital.",5

I did pretty well and there are many strategies that even I can think of but you'll lose every once in awhile and then you have to frickin study on new tactics.

com.chess,The Dewser,The puzzle challenges are unclear on how points are granted or deducted. Their FAQ says it is based on rating yet every puzzle on a free account is unrated. So you might get 5 points for one puzzle but make a wrong move on another and you get 13 points taken away even if it is with the correct piece to move. Very discouraging to be at 900 then have your score plummet due to imaginary rated puzzles and massive point deductions.,3

com.chess,Norman Ridley,I really suck at chess.,5
com.chess,Fariborz Irani,Puzzles are absolutely stupid. Shows ridiculous scenarios that no player with half a brain would walk themselves into. And starts cutting scores for taking longer than 10 seconds to think stupidly to solve a stupid puzzle. Remove the feature or put realistic scenarios to solve.,3

com.chess,Kieran Kniveton,"An extra star has been given for the daily chess puzzles, but the whole user experience isn't worth it unless you shell out for the diamond membership. I highly recommend people use lichess instead which is free and open source, and has a far superior system for playing with your friends. There also seems to be a bug on Android where the bots play incredibly high above their actual level. They are easily beatable on PC but play like gods on Android.",2

com.chess,CAPTURE,Superb game,5
com.chess,A. B.,Now that I played thousands of games I can say with something approaching authority that the scoring system is completely nonsensical and is in fact insulting. I've read through it to try to understand how they do it and it's still just seems like a horrible system,1

I went from 400 to 800 in like 6 months. Every holiday there are special computers you can play against. Like Santa Claus for Christmas and Jack O' for Halloween. If you aren't using this app you are missing out big time. Just try it and get your first Game Report. You will be hooked from there.,5

Lessons are really good, I do wish I could revisit older ones without triggering the 1 lesson a week free limit Opportunity to join leagues and tournaments if you're into that. One flaw is challenging friends, your rating can become inflated, so when you play someone random you get matched to someone way better",5

com.chess,Cameron King,Love it,5
com.chess,Sam Rocco,"Very solid user experience. Lessons are helpful, puzzles are neat, and the look is sleek and simple. One thing I don't understand is why this app drinks your battery like a milkshake. It becomes especially apparent after two or three games, when the phone will heat up, the app will begin to drop frames, and you'll lose two or three percent in as many minutes. Not a deal breaker, but confusing for an app that seems like it shouldn't really tax your hardware.",4

com.chess,Alan Argent,Perfect chess app. Simple interface to let you enjoy the game. You get matched with players who are about your standard so you get to enjoy losing and winning. Analysis so you can see how to improve. Daily puzzles are great and there are also lessons available. Some features are only for paid subscribers but in my opinion worth every penny.,5

com.chess,Mohamedqathar Hassan,Just outstanding!,5
com.chess,diametrically opposing theorist always say no,It's just to funny. It seemed as though instead of letting me claim a great victory. It shut down and said it was a draw before I could finish the game. Weird because I played the computer. Good graphics and easy screen sense on the eyes. One of the better online versions I've seen and played. May try again later.,4
com.chess,Mohammed M Massalay,Work just perfect,5
com.chess,laughing 2 nafis,This game is awesome,5
com.chess,Eric Marcel,"This app can do everything except what it's supposed to. Why is it that I should pay for a membership on service that disconnects me from games for no aparent reason? Also, how can the devs not see a problem on you clicking start a new game and there being no feedback until you click again, when it says ""there's a challenge already present"", as if I should know that. Also, what part of exiting the game search screen means abort game search is so hard to understand?",2

Also when I don't open the app for some time and I had puzzle rush open it doesn't let me continue what I did previously and only shows me a blank chess board. But other than that it is a fairly good app. Desktop version is still preferred by me because it has more features and game modes but I hope they will add more and more stuff in the future,3

We've found that we can get it to work if we both send invites to each other at the same time, but even that doesn't work 100% of the time.",3

com.chess,Rob P,Excellent app. Strong recommendation to use it if you want to up your chess game. The 5 daily puzzles are just enough to get a good taste but not spend too much time playing. The post game analysis is cool too. I suspect the pay-for services are even better but that is my thing generally.,5
com.chess,mc ink,4 ‚≠ê star app i do recommend installing. Their is some small bugs when making a move or playing for long hours the app close on its on giving me the L. At first it didn't really bother but it happens to often Also the game needs a better way of auto abort it only starts at the first 30s after that if my opponent leaves the game i have to wait what ever time left and this also give me the L i cant wait to avoid this add a 1m per move instead of a 5m timer for 1 game if player don't move then is L,4

It's not coincidence when the only ai I haven't beat is the original one because it blocks itself into a corner and the game draws. That's literally how you play chess. You put them in check. It is the worst mechanic in any chess game I've ever played. I encourage you all to uninstall or never install it to begin with.",1

I've taken other chess engines and put it against the 1200 level AI or against Nelson, I've seen Nelson win against level 1800 chess ai on other apps, even smoke a 1500 on this same app (using my wife's phone). Seriously it's messed up. Can you fix this? For people who are a level 1200 IRL it's very frustrating",2

If you don't pay, then you can take one lesson a week. The lessons take like ten minutes max. You're still limited to 5 a week by paying $7 a month. Unlimited is $14 a month. It's just kinda disappointing, since you can find all of that info for free online.",3
com.chess,Da Man,I have never been into chess. this app teaches you the fundamentals of chess for a beginner like myself but I also see that it can even teach a seasoned vet a thing or 2.

com.chess,Caleigh Knight,So basically if you like chess you probably shouldn't get this app. People resign left and right the moment you get an edge up on them. The amount of times I've taken a queen and then they immediately resign is phenomenal. Anytime you get close to a checkmate the other person resigns So they don't have a checkmate on record. If you're clearly 1 or 2 moves away from a checkmate they resign. And if you report them nothing happens. Despite you agreeing in terms & conditions not to do that.,1

For example, I move a pawn from f2 to f4, beside an enimy pawn at g4, at which point the g4 pawn goes to f3, capturing the f4 pawn. It's happened multiple times to me so I'm sure it's a bug they'll patch soon.",5

The openings book can be enabled on daily games which seems like a good way to cheat as well. Those are my only concerns. Playing rapid/blitz/bullet doesn't give you this option thankfully. The other improvement that could be made is this. There's a special checkmate noise that happens when CM'ing before you can confirm move. Advantages,5

Even after reporting the issue multiple times, there has not been any action or correction to the ratings.

Same setup as 1, except go game options->resign and it will sometimes resign the wrong game. 3. Probably other similar bugs. Your engineers need to update the map or vector properly",5

I mostly use the learning features of this app and when I'm playing Custom Position against the engine, there's no way to go back after I get mated after some dumb move. Another useful feature (not nearly as frustrating) would be to force the engine to make some move - it'd help understanding why it wasn't chosen. There's also a bug: with some combination of back/forward/replay/change engine strength, it gets stuck and the engine doesn't make any moves anymore. Pro: developers read and respond to the reviews :)",3
