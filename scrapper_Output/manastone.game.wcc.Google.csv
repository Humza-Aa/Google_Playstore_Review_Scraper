manastone.game.wcc.Google,Sam Tshabalala,Cool !!! I've been playing this game for about 5 years now and still enjoying it but sheeeeeeesh.... Recently ads have taken their toll. They come in after every game and most of them doesn't go even if U want them to. U may try as much as U can but they linger on until their time expires. Some gets jammed and their 5 seconds timing gets to be one minute long because they jam and doesn't go. There is also an ads free app that we have to buy to remove them. Ouch... it is no more fun as before.,4.0

And maybe actual tournaments where you have to log in at certain time. That would be really fun and inovative and i believe would make you the unanimous top chess app.",5.0

manastone.game.wcc.Google,Divyang,Its overall one of the best chess online games out there gets real quality players to play with. Don't know what's happened after the recent update I guess it just gives up automatically if I'm thinking for too long... doesn't matter I have time left or not. It just pops up that you gave up. That is absolutely frustrating when that happens. Earlier it used to pop up and asked if player is still there thinking or just left but now it gives up straight away even with time left.

Once this game is back to how it was I'd give it the five Stars I gave it originally. Until then I'm uninstalling this bs,1.0

Are there bigger tournaments with more entrants? Please add bigger brackets as I'm sure most people like a march madness style tournament. 3d graphics could use some angling work because it's hard to tell what pieces are where sometimes because smaller pieces can be slightly hidden from larger ones. Some explanations needed for which buttons do what on the main screen. A great game with great potential!,4.0

I do however like to go back & look at my replays bc strategy is something I need help with & games I've won would help me in the future. The game says I can review any replay at anytime yet even when I have just finished a game it will not let me watch it. That is my only dislike so far. I have a friend that might add this game bc he would play against me so I have not tried the 2 player yet. I would really like to be able to see my replays.,3.0

As far as your reply, I put my opponent in check, and instead of blocking the check or getting out of check he put me in check while he was still in check. This has happened at least four different times. Your game is flawed. If my opponent can have that option turned off, then it is not real chess. You don't have chess, because that is not how chess rules work. You have a little kids game. My option was turned on, I couldn't do the same, and wouldn't want to either. I will stick with aps that have real chess, not some made up version. Flawed, flawed, flawed. Waste of time. Lol, if I was playing chess with someone in person, and I put them in check, I say, ""Check"" that is real chess. Your option to be allowed to move while remaining in check is not real chess.

manastone.game.wcc.Google,A Google user,"The main thing I like is that there is a rating system, plenty of players and fairly fast hybrid timing system - 5 minutes timer and after that runs out you have 30 seconds per move. You get to exhaust this once and if you do it again its game over. But there are bugs. Most are ok, but one crazy bug was: opponent was allowed to move his king into danger! I was shocked. It was near the end game and I was winning so it was ok. But I had to actually capture his king to win the game. This is a huge bug! You should not be allowed to move king into danger. That is the rule of chess. So if you accidentally do it, the opponent can capture and win the game. This is wrong. You guys are saying it is the opponents wish, well that is wrong because it is against the rules of chess. You should not allow it in the official ranked game.",4.0

manastone.game.wcc.Google,A Google user,"Love the fact that I can play people from around the world.  But there are two major issues with the game.  First, there are no user instructions for all of the features of the app.  I don't have any way to look up how to obtain any of the accomplishments, or how to use the various options of the app.  Secondly, and far more importantly, there are way too many people who have figured out how to cheat.  About 1 out of every 5 games I play is against someone who has figured out how to put more time on the clock.  Very frustrating to be playing by the rules, and have your opponent with unlimited time to figure out his next move.  It simply isn't fair.  I have even played a couple of time where the opponent was able to reset the match and basically take back a move or two.  If these issues could be fixed, I would rate it 5 stars without a doubt.  Changing my review to one star due to the fact that the cheating is getting worse.  Now I have run into someone who can get the game disconnected, and when it reconnects, I have lost over a minute of time on my clock while their clock is back to 5:00; 'Canada 9 Guep the first' is his login.",1.0

Yes the devs disclose that in the description and say it's ""your own responsibility"", but they have the nerve to still call it ""World Chess Championship"" now that is funny. Since you are changing rules anyway, why not make queens move like Knights too?  I mean they are the most powerful piece on the board right?  Why not make Kings moves like kings can in checkers?  How about if a pawn captures a Knight, the pawn can mount the rider less horse and turn into a knight? Afterall it should be ""your own responsibility"" that your knight isn't captured by a pawn.

In chess, you MUST move your king, block the check, or eliminate the threat if you are in check. But in this game, you can simply ignore check. This is definately against chess rules. If you went to a state, national, or world wide championship, and you left your king in check, you would be disqualied immediately, and you would be disrepected by all the viewers for breaking the rules in a gentlemans game, especially at a championship.

manastone.game.wcc.Google,A Google user,It' the best chess app I've played so far. One thing though. If you can reward the winner at the finals stage with 3 stars that would make the game even more addicting. Rather than wait 30 minutes per star. Only the loser should wait 30 minutes per star.   Never thought you would actually make the reward system... i was surprised to see it happen after winning a tournament... good job.,5.0

manastone.game.wcc.Google,A Google user,I love the fact that there is no check warning and that players can move into check. It makes you have to pay more attention.    What I don't like is that there is no way to report cheaters. I have had many games where I am winning and the player will disconnect and come back and his time clock does not wind down..and then suddenly he has a pawn at my base ready to turn into a queen. I went back and watched the replay. He essentially changed a couple moves I made and there was nothing I could do about it.,5.0
manastone.game.wcc.Google,A Google user,Nice first try. Please do not start charging for this,1.0
manastone.game.wcc.Google,A Google user,"In my first game, my opponent neglected to move out of check, and rather,  moved to put me in check at the same time.  I found that it states clearly in the app description that it doesn't provide any help or assistance for check/suicidal moves. Why not? I watched the video on their website too, and it shows a king not move out of check, and then the game ends when the king is taken.  This is an odd version of chess that i don't want to play.",1.0

manastone.game.wcc.Google,A Google user,"Very poor execution. Chess Engine breaks the rules of Chess (there are no checks in this game or illegal moves based off checks...it will allow you to capture your opponent's king after moving the king into check. For example, you can walk you king right next to an opponent's queen and keep ot there for several moves, and then have the queen capture the king!) There are no directions. The time controls are awful and impossible to figure out, (something like 5 min game but then once you go under a minute left they add 30 sec per move, then if u run out of time you get three additional 30 second times added after each additional time that u run out of time. After playing Chess competitively around the world for a long time and placing in some of the world's best tournaments, I can tell you that the way this game operates IS NOT CHESS. Further, it is continually disconnecting you, even when you have a solid internet connection. Awful.	Whomever designed this game literally does not know the rules of Chess. Hands down the worst chess program I have ever played.",1.0

I can say for me and others who play with or without experience,  just add check to the g as me feature and i will give it 5 stars. But as of now I will give 3.",3.0

manastone.game.wcc.Google,A Google user,I really enjoy the unique features of this Chess App. The replay feature allows you to study and try out different lines on every single game you have ever played. I think its ace how your opponent can move themselves into check if they're not smart entough to notice and to top it off most most players here are not as experienced as on other websites and apps.  This is a great app for beginners and experienced players looking to try out new ideas.,5.0

manastone.game.wcc.Google,A Google user,"Ok before you tell me it's real world chess. I am a national expert. 1. This game neglects the rule that the king cannot place itself in check and it neglects the fact it must take care of check before continuing. 2. I played almost 10 games before uninstalling because the competition was too weak. People played like they were complete beginners. Knowing nothing about basic strategy. If you charge for this and don't know there are better sites that are free, you should do some research. Hope this helps.",1.0

manastone.game.wcc.Google,A Google user,"This is a good game, the very best of it.  It allows you play chees like in a real world . When your king is in check you can decide to move any other soldier at your risk. If you don't knw your king is in check then its your problem you have to accept defeat . In a real world game, your opponent can decide not to notify you on check thats a good defeat strategy. But if they can add a 'check' voice notification ,good ......if not the game is still very very special.",5.0
