giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,HUMN RACE,"Great clock, and a MUST DOWNLOAD.. Better than any other clock on the play store.. BUT my only and i mean only gripe... and it may be nitpicking but i cannot give 5 stars because it shows a color wheel on the preference tab, but has no option to customize appearance... Im sorry team, i love the app... but sheesh, and that was a tease to put the color wheel on there like that. Edit*** Just changed to 5 stars.. Turned on C/CM buttons, the ""white cannot CM in 2 moves"" was a very nice little detail",5
giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,Momen Abukhadijah,"Everything is well, but the check button should be audioable or make a special sound",4
giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,Neil Fitzcharles,fun for the family,5

giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,Christie Udobong,It is very good,5
giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,Jack Sankey,"Nicely configurable, does what I want. In settings, some fonts don't quite fit in their zones, causing some ugly clipping and wrapping (the worst is the word ""Bronstein"" which has an 'n' on the next line, half clipped. I'm on a pixel 4a with android 12.",5
giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,M. Mazet,do the job,5

giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,H∆∞ng Ng√¥,Can we time each chess move as well? (eg. 15 minutes for each game / 2 minutes for each move),5
giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,David Carling,Nice app. Only one I can find that allows giving time odds. One nice build would be an option to hide the hundreths of a second.,5
giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,J. Vallon,Even better than the one I had before. Design is clean and clear,5
giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,Milahn Atchison,This is a great app for chess players! I love it!,5
giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,jv2080 ‚Äújv2080‚Äù,I don't like the different sounds it makes when the other player presses his turn. I wish it were a uniform sound.. Nor need the 'error' sound when you press it and it's not your turn.,3
giulio.di.maria.chessclock.google,Soumyadip Paul,Finally my search has ended. A free clock with all possible features. Best in the market.,5
