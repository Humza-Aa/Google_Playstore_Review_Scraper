com.vanniktech.chessclock,Tayyab Mohammad,"Absolutely perfect....the app does exactly what it needs too, and a bit more....I actually discovered this app when I went for competition and the timers didn't work so our next alternative was the app....and that has to say something. The app is amazing and is easy to navigate around.....so thank you to the creators and developers of this app.",5
com.vanniktech.chessclock,Fabian Schocke (Indrome),"Uninstalled after 20 seconds. No horizontal orientation support, collects ad data en masse like your garden-variety website with no one-click opt-out. |||| Reply to dev: I use a tablet and place it standing next to the board, facing it, so we don't have to crane our necks over the table to read the timers. (In addition, about close to 100% of handheld devices these days are capable of horizontal orientation. Why wouldn't a utility app support that out of the box?)",1
com.vanniktech.chessclock,Ashish Shukla,that app is awesome,5
com.vanniktech.chessclock,Mitu Roy,Best timer to play chess I love vey much its very timer than the other chess timers I love it but I thing is bad is when a player moves any pices after clicking it the timer not produce any sound but only vibrate please add a sound other wise it very very good.,5

com.vanniktech.chessclock,A Google user,"What more can we ask? Perfect application for chess players. Only a chess player can understand its importance. I would like to add one suggestion. It would have been much better if we could add those time increments after certain moves like 20 or 30 as per our wish. Anways, lots of thanks for developing this application.",5

com.vanniktech.chessclock,A Google user,Very simple to operate. I like it. I'm not one for criticising a free app but I see that the developer sometimes asks for suggestions. Possibly a facility to add additional time controls after the first is reached would improve the app? e.g. 40 moves in 2 hours and then 20 moves in the next hour.,4

com.vanniktech.chessclock,A Google user,"Excellent chess clock app! It has the three features I most look for: (1) unambiguous, intuitive ease of use; (2) option for different controls for each player; (3) unambiguous fixed display (HH:MM:SS). Few apps have all three of these. One nice additional option would be a warning sound when time is close to expiring (for example a ticking clock when less than 10 seconds left).",5
