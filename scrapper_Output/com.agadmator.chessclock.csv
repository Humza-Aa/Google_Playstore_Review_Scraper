com.agadmator.chessclock,Great Ape Adventure,Lacks features like a move counter and some additional time increments.,4
com.agadmator.chessclock,Devan Kingsford,Fantastic. Love the whole screen button so you don't have to be so precise and dexterous when you're in a quick game,5
com.agadmator.chessclock,Dan Walker,Simple and effective. Love it,5
com.agadmator.chessclock,Urban Pompe,we nduRR= rjNNs\\| e.sgigyqsvgyby,3
com.agadmator.chessclock,Mateus Rodolfo,Good app. Would be 5 stars if one could choose between Bronstein and simple delay on settings. For now there's only the simple delay option.,4
com.agadmator.chessclock,muhammad farooqui,"Very intuitive app, would have appreciated move counter option that can be linked with various time control games.",5
com.agadmator.chessclock,Andrea Balandini,"Excellent!!! I wish you could adjust the font size, the numbers seem a bit small",5
com.agadmator.chessclock,Karl Weyenberg,"Simple, aestthically pleasing. The click sound when you hit the clock is very pleasing as well.",5
com.agadmator.chessclock,Shawn,"Simply the best and cleanest chess clock UI in the entire app store. Very easy to use. If possible tho, I think if u make a feature to add different ""stages"" (e.g. Adding 30 minutes after 40 moves and maybe even custom increments in each stage) then the app will be perfect.",4
com.agadmator.chessclock,Secret Squirrel,Perfect,5
com.agadmator.chessclock,Jack Sankey,"Nice clock but visually unintuitive. The person whose turn it is is muted in color, while the other person has a bright red pause button. I kept thinking it was the wrong person's turn and it added confusion to the game (on dark theme, but light theme looked similarly confusing). Anyway, it's a nice app, but the pause button muted, like gray, and have a bright red highlight around the time that is currently ticking down (or something more elegant) so it's easy to see from peripheral vision.",4
com.agadmator.chessclock,Peace Benson,Nice app It's very simple and still does what is required. You can even set a custom clock.,5
com.agadmator.chessclock,TROY GAYMING,Thank you agadmator,5

com.agadmator.chessclock,Jaitrik,Awesome,5
com.agadmator.chessclock,Emil Boboc,"There is no feedback option in the app. No updates for more than a year. There is no way to mute the sound or change it to something less annoying. Otherwise, great app! I will rate 5‚≠ê once improvements are made.",1
com.agadmator.chessclock,zancospancos,"Aesthetically pleasing interface. I appreciate how it resizes after each player hits it. Custom clock setting names and display of exact settings are good. However, I wish the clock had stages so I could have 15 minutes for the first 40 moves and 5 minutes for sudden death for example.",4
com.agadmator.chessclock,David Polehonski,"Great app, smooth interface. Only thing missing is additional bonus time when you reach a given number of moves (and a move counter).",4

com.agadmator.chessclock,Vladimir Fernandez Pepo,This one application is fantastic.And very effective.,5
com.agadmator.chessclock,Alef Pereira,"I like this app, but I miss some features and have some improvements I'd like to recommend. 1. Would be great to support multi-stage time control functionality. This would allow to use this app for classical FIDE time control for example. 2. Also an option to show a move counter. 3. The other thing is related to the position of the time text, which are diagonally opposed, for one player this seems strange to look to it's own clock, and for the other player it seems strange to look to the opponent's clock. (a landscape option would also be great)",4

com.agadmator.chessclock,Taijiro Bernstein,Excellent app! It's not clear to me what toggling green arrows in the time edit screen does. Maybe some indicator or small FAQ might help. Edit:. the red arrows seems to prevent forcing symmetrical time! default green means change one color time makes the other equal.,5
com.agadmator.chessclock,Marlon McAllister,"Exactly what I was looking for. Its not actually for chess. I needed a double timer for work where I could start 1 timer when I do work and start the second timer for when something stops me (poor IT performance, interruption or fixing something that shouldn't be needed). Thank you.",5
com.agadmator.chessclock,D Hatter,"Thanks for this great app and of course for all the videos on agadmator's YouTube channel.

com.agadmator.chessclock,Eoin,"This app is perfect. I have tried many other chess clocks and some of them are horrendous. I read the complaints looking for a dark mode, i actually think that would make it worse, it's whatever for me. Also another saying they wanted a sound when you hit the clock, that is there now. The way the area that you can touch expands on your move is a great feature. Other than that, simple UI, simple presets, no rubbish. In this position, download the app and 'Captures, captures, captures'",5

com.agadmator.chessclock,ariel zabate cuizon,"Aside from youtube, I also love this chess clock than any other here. Very unique and more space to touch/press. Only one thing, just one thing very important I think, When time is up, do not put the reset button in the center, have it same location with the pause button. Because during bullet, the reset button can be pressed and may cause doubts which side expired.",5
