com.zynga.chess.googleplay,Peter A,"If there was a zero. I'd give it that. How would you like to be in a 50-move game, investing weeks, and are well in the end game. Then all of a sudden, you get an out of sync/corrupt game. I left this app almost 2 years ago and when I came back had ""moments to go left"" and 600 days!!!! My story isn't unique.

I say ""simple"" b/c the program lacks advanced options for time settings. Instead each move must be played within 5 days. This works really well for correspondence style play however. I do wish the game had a way to invite players by email. The only downside is that sometimes a game will get corrupted for no reason. Hence 4/5. All & all, a great app!",4

You can't change any of your info in settings because of all the bugs. 80% of games get ""corrupted "" and you can't do anything with them. You get random ""Losses"" for no reason, even when you haven't finished a single game yet. Messaging customer support is a joke. It doesn't matter if you attach photos of the issues or anything, they will not assist. Someone will just send you a scripted message over and over again about how 2 access your setting",1

It seems some players know how to trigger the bug and are using it to avoid being tagged with losses. Also, the matching algorithm seems totally random. Serious chess servers let you get automatically matched with players roughly the same strength. Maybe this is actually a feature for some high rated players, but I don't see the fun in just beating up on way lower rated players in 90% of your games. It's possible to get around this by scanning the ranking list for players the same strength, but this isn't as good as the automatic pairing feature, because the people you challenge might not even be active, and it seems that the challenger always only gets white, and it's more fun to play both white and black.

Ah! But they're not gone, they just stay there on ongoing games, but I can neither play nor delete them. Also, it seems to me Indian players have found a hack in the system and they abuse it. I show a loss against one of these guys that never actually happened. I have a significant advantage over him in our ongoing game, and he just keeps stalling.

The bugs do not allow finish many exciting games, because of the error 'Corrupted game!' and 'The game is out of sync..'. I repeat these bugs were not always there and appeared at some point. I found an artificial way how to avoid these issues. To prevent the bugs, one needs to check if the time since the last move is written on the particular active chessgame. If it is not there, then one needs to keep updating the game list until the time appears. After that it is safe to open the chessboard. I hope this way will help you to understand where the issues in the code are (you are welcome). Please let me know once the issues are repaired.

relatively easy to undo by going back to the main screen dashboard and 
opening the game back. - notification languages - sporadically when I get a

I have been able to review and even replay at least the last couple games. and what it better tjan being able to chat about it with other players? and then I can plug it into that anaylisis app ,I think, not sure yet. Now I am recording videos of the games and the ability to back up and review the game move by move helps that process immensely! You can even set up a parallel game with a coach or friend and play your bad moves differently! Full page ads are poorly timed when you are concentrating.

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Simple interface. Mutiplayer is good. Ads are after every move. Annoying but needed I guess. $9.99 to get ads removed is kinda steep. Not too sure who the ads are targeting though. Seen some alcohol advertisements and skimpy anime game ads. The game should be labeled for the appropriate age if you ask me. My son won't be getting on this game for that reason alone.,3

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Needs an update, but works fine. Minor bugs - sometimes shows captured piece in place of the attacking piece.",4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Very engaging, love the casual setting as well.  Like how I can actually talk to players.",5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Fine game in a good presentation,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,It's too bad there's not a time limit option. It would be nice to have an option that would allow you to complete a game in less than a month. Other apps allow tinned or not timed.,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Horrible  , ad crazy , too much for people to do nobody playing just sitting there not moving",1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Fun for basic chess. Would love to see other options like picking your color, time clocks, and chess960.",4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Good game that I enjoy playing with friends from all over.,5

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Way too many ads,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Fun to play with grandchildren,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Was great until all three games I was playing became corrupted. Attempting a restart and a log off like suggested in their website caused me not to be able to log back on. I don't have a Facebook account so it's asking me to create a brand new user. I paid for this. I think I would like my money back. It's a great idea but until they get it figured out I wouldn't spend money here.,2
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,It's an ad delivery app that lets you play chess,2
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,It use to be a better game before all of the out of snyc games.,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Zynga added ads back to the app after I had already purchased the premium app. Essentially stealing from me.,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,too many ads,2
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I love this game but 3 days ago it said there was an error and a restart was required. Now it won't load my games. It just keeps saying updating. Please fix!!!!,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I have been playing for years and still love it!!,5

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,The game its not working ...fixed it and i will change my rate,2
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Hey my app was working fine for 1 month last. In this January problems started. Not able to sync with your server properly.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Love playing all the different players, some play fast some it takes awhile. That's okay,  this is chess. Great way to play your friends from around the world.",5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,The adds are too much,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Be careful, I just lost all my stats and haven't gotten them back. Thinking about a boycott ... I had 378 games won to 83 games lost, 1603 rating and the game,  my profile crashed. I emailed them,  they said they fixed it,  but I still lost all the players I've played with, along with the current games I was playing, and every stat I had.... I'm beyond mad about this.  They should be able to fix this. Don't see why they can't, they created the game,  they could create my profile back. And after many emails, no one is smart enough to get this restored.  Coming from a family of network engineers, they all agreed that the people behind this app can give back,  what they took away. Why they won't, is beyond my understanding coming up with excuses and disregard to my request. And New update 1/7/18; Previously, I had to start over.  Now, im 100 wins to 72 losses.  Not great, I know, but it seems that the 22 games I have in progress are now frozen in time and I'm not able to start any new games as I do think they (zynga chess), are having issues again!!!!. Really sucks as I have some good games going on and now I can't play them,  im going to be forced to find another app and stop supporting zynga games altogether.  Unless they fix and restore my current games and stats.",1

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Unlimited time makes chess unfun for me, waiting 2 days for someone to make a move is ridiculous i waited  a week.",1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I imagine this doesn't have as many players as WWF as it seems a bit neglected by Zynga. But people do play it so there's no shortage of opponents. But don't get too upset if your games get corrupted and you lose your progress.,3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Worst app, do not download, i got the paid version without adds for $10, and  yesterday was playing 10 games and was winning on all of them, than got an error game out of sync and all the games were forcely closed ,so frustrating.

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Sucks to sum it up,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Many issues I have with this app. The so-called ""smart match"" constantly pairs me with people no where near my skill set, and the rating system seems flawed. If you want to play against the computer, the AI in this app is terrible. There is also a glitch where after I capture a piece, it displays the wrong piece on the board and I have to exit the game and reenter to see the board properly. Finally, there is no option for timed games, so games could take a day or a month to complete, which isn't even chess to me... in my opinion, this is the worst chess app I've ever used.",2
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Great looking game just way to many long commercials,3

I was leading with a queen piece and after a move, it says ""They declined"" from the opponent and the match is finished. The result stats of this match is not counted either loss or win on my profile too. Sad that this happened. Have the screenshot ready if you guys are ready to fix it. Or else I just have to uninstall game. The present ratings will change after a reply/no reply from devs in 3 days time. Thank you.  Reviewing again on 2nd Jan, 2018 There is a match where my opponent seems to left the game. This has been more than 70 days ago. Yet there is no result. All it said was ""moments ago left"" for more than 2 months. Sad that this app devs can't fix this.

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Works well for what its title suggests, but I've had more than a few tech issues. If an opponent times out on a game, it doesn't count as an automatic win, but rather the game stays in limbo until one of the Tech Support workers fixes it, or I resign the game. Despite putting multiple tickets for this same issue, I never see a permanent fix.  I've also had a game where I couldn't submit a legal move. The ads are very frequent (after every single move,) but I suppose that's the price to pay for a free app. I also can't play a practice game as Black, and the Expert AI really isn't all that great.  If it weren't for a few tech issues, and tech support being more reliable, I'd rate the game maybe a 4 out of 5. I guess Zynga just doesn't care that much.",2

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Too many ads,3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"The main function of playing others is very good. Leaderboards and ratings allow you to find or be matched with players of similar skill and there is such a large group of people on at all times that it is easy to find another player very quickly whatever time it is. Being able view old games for yourself as well as others, while keeping track of wins, losses, and draws is a nice feature as well. The chess clubs you can create are a nice feature, but there is no good sorting system and a lack of options within them, as well as the fact that you can only join any one club at a time. The weakest part of the app is the computer opponent which only has three difficulties: beginner, intermediate, and expert. The CPU difficulties are basically designed solely with beginners in mind. The intermediate and expert are a 3 and  5 out of 10, respectively. There are no options on how to tweak your computer opponent. It would be an improvement to be able to change the CPU 's  properties with respect to: aggression or conservation; board strategy and piece placement; which pieces the CPU favors or doesn't; and allow you to set up your own board to test you in certain tactics; have the computer play better in certain positions while being weak in others etc. As well as a wide berth of difficulties. I know there are other apps for these things specifically, but it shouldn't be hard to design a good flexible computer player.  As well, with all the game data from all the hundreds of thousands of players, the computer could automatically adjust to play on your weaknesses in certain areas or simulate the top players' game styles. That's something no other chess app I know of has the ability to do without you having to plug in the game data yourself and no one can plug in the millions of games played. It's a unique opportunity to make a great social chess app into a complete chess app.",5

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Do it,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I definitely say 5 stars overall and this by far is one of my favourite Zynga apps. I only have one slight control issue and it seems to be with opening active games. I tap to open but a majority of the time I have to tap it a dozen times if not more to get it to open. I thought at first maybe it was a loading issue so I have just tapped once and waited but it never opened. It seems I have to consistently tap as I have been to open any active game. If anyone else has the issue it is still worth the minor inconvience just keep tapping it will open eventually. Other than that I don't have any negative thing to say but a bunch of positives. It is a great way to improve chess skills and play with new people. It is an amazing social app and I really enjoy it - even more than Words. Love the game guys!,5

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,App monetisation is fine but not at the cost of user experience. Too many ads for a game that requires concentration.,2
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I think it's not a game it's an advertisement app! Who in the hell would put this many ads on a game and call it good or even close to decent. I'm not paying for 399 to you to remove my ads. You stupid Fox that create games need to figure out a way to include your ads without bothering the game player or else your game is f****** useless no matter how good it is or what it is ADS ruin everything,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Good enough. Some bugs. Sometimes doesn't update when one of your pieces is taken. Looks like it is still your old piece. Slow too. I know because me and my wife will play part of a game during the day and finish it at night when I get home. Sometimes we don't bother finishing. Get out a real chess board and play a new game. Fun to play with friends that live far away though. Currently playing an old roommate.,4

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I loved this app until I had an issue with my phone which caused me to have to go back to factory settings (Not Zynga's fault). What find completely ridiculous is that if you do not have a facebook account there does not seem to be a way to reenter credentials to retrieve an old account.  What happens is instead of a sign in you are routed to a create new account. When you try to enter an old account is the app comes back with that account already exist. I have tried to go through support but all I get is the boiler plate instructions from the help screen. Since I am unable to get them to understand I am retracting my previous rating due to terrible costumer support.,1

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"This game has cheats. I captures the opponents queen and mine just disappeared. It displayed the opponents queen in the square where mine was. I thought at first it was a graphics overlay issue but when it came turn to move it was not an overlay issue it just ate my queen. That plus the adds after every move makes it impossible to complete a game let alone find out if you like it enough to want to puchase the add free version. Great simplistic layout if it did not have these issues. Too bad. Seemed nice, too flawed.",1

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I'm digging it so far. The game seems to bog down on loading games in progress (maybe more of a hardware issue than software) but a great way to kill time on and off throughout the day.,4

Firstly, I expected to pay 3.99 to play the full game without ads and ended up paying ¬£8.49.  I decided to pay anyway but then it became apparent the game has some technical issues.  My friend was unable to move his queen after a few moves as on his screen it had turned into one of my rooks! My board meanwhile was represented correctly (after having my rook taken by his queen).  Such a shame, hope it gets sorted. I don't mind paying a premium but not for faulty goods!",1

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"I downloaded this so I could play chess. Sadly this app is buggy as all get out.  1: pieces that have been captured will stay on the board visually. Someone I was playing with took my bishop with their rook. Their next turn, my bishop was on the board and their rook wasn't. Rebooting the game fixed that. Still, that's not good enough for a company that makes as money as Zynga does. 2: pieces' moves were not always displayed properly. Sometimes potential captures were not displayed as available, moreover trying to take the (unprotected) piece with a king was not possible.  Basic concept: fine. Execution: poor.",2

Those who are afraid to display their skills are cowards. Ban them temporarily, probably a few months. If they continue, forever.",3

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"My go to app to pay chess with my friend. I always have a half dozen games going on at once. It's pretty good, but there are a few frustrating things. First of all it would be great to be able to request to take a move back for drunk mistakes. It should require the opponent to agree. Next it's infuriating that you can not choose if you want to be black or white when issuing a challenge. The challenger is always white. Finally there is an amusing bug on the alerts, often times they are not in English. It isn't an issue that prevents use, but it's existed as long as I've used this app (over a year)",4

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Great simple and easy. Perfect chess app. How about an speed game option with a timer so 2 players can play continously,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Ad cancer,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,too slow.,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Love this game. Keeps me engaged w long distance friends. But when I go to click each game it usually take 15-20 taps in different spots on the game box till the game gets highlighted and opens. I have a galaxy note 5.,5

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,It is a nice way to play chess. Seems to freeze up sometimes though.,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Maybe make a game where you can exit the ads when they pop up and not just be able to sit there and watch them that's really stupid and when you try to do something on the game it says their moves that it still that they're freaking there in like that you do they haven't made a move yet so it makes no sense that we removed but it's actually supposed to be your move it makes no sense whatsoever so you need to fix that like real fast because what was your phone,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,This app is great for starting up games with random strangers or friends.  You can convince all your friends with words with friends to play this too if you want to get better at chess.,5

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Gets the job done. Other than the ads, in game play is good. The out of game UI leaves a lot to be desired. Could be simpler and have better flow.

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,If it works a bit faster then it looks good,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I would give this app a better review but when I went to pay to disable ads which it says is 3.99 USD it brings up a window to pay but the total is 12.99.

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"This game is a great way to improve your game by playing with strangers and your pals. After a few games, it starts to match you with players of your caliber. The more you play, the better you get matched.  There's also a nice chat feature in the game. I've made a few friends who are perfect matches and play regularly. Also, there's no rush wth the games. You have five days to make a move if your life gets too busy to focus on the game. There are a lot of ads in the game, sometimes it's like you get an ad screen after every move. Sometiimes the ads dont show up for every few days, it's kinda odd. Anyhow, they aren't manditory, there's always an X to quit the the ads.   TL,DR; great games, play with friends or strangers. Cool chat feature to make new pals, espescially if they're awesome partners. Ignore the ads, just quit 'em. Get the app.",4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Pretty good to be able to play with other people. Sometimes when you take a piece it still shows your opponent's piece that you took so that can get confusing but typically only lasts a move in my experience.

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"I've had two games now (completed, that is) with others in progress. I think it's great.  I like how you can allow it to ask you to confirm a move before you commit to it.  (Not everyone would agree.)  and it's great to play against others in different time zones all over the world and at different skill levels.  Only issue I have that I can't see how the skill rating system works. I've had a win and a loss and players with higher ratings, and naturally my rating has gone up but I don't know how it arrived at my current score!",4

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,The game is alright if you have hours and hours to spend playing one game. It would be fine if commercials showed but after EVERY MOVE is a little inconvenient. Plus some of the ads you can't even skip and are up to 15 seconds. Sure...15 seconds isn't a long time but 10 moves in you're already about 2 minutes of not even playing the game and you have to wait for your opponent as well who has to watch ads for those 2 minutes. The pieces all look okay at best but I don't care if i was actually play the game.,1

Cons:  -With the free version, it will burn through data if you are not on wifi. I play around 7 people at a time and make around 20+ moves per day with each player. Ads come up after every move; that's a lot of data.  - Blocking rude players will cause you to lose the current match.

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Too many ads. I mean too many. And people can wait for 4.9 Days in a losing position then they can make their move. Annoying. But the game itself is like regular chess.  One improvement they can make is create ""Conditional moves"" option. A feature that allows players to register their desired moves in advance, before their opponent moves. So, in the opening, for example,  I can create a condition as black. If white plays 1. e4, then I go 1... e5. This helps a lot in endgames when you have a winning position and the opponent is stalling. You can simply put your moves in and not have to wait forever for them to respond. Or create different time controls for certain move number. Like, each player would only have 1 day instead of 5 when move 40 is reached.  Over all, the app in ad-infested, broken, but it is playable.",2

The price of the app is also overpriced at just over 10 USD. I can only speculate that the price is high so that you don't want to purchase the app because that would mean not getting any ads, which is the primary source of their income. Game is also a touch laggy at times. upside is that you can play multiple games with anyone from around the world. there is also a computer 2 play",3

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,This app forced me Into accepting a draw due to repetition when only my opponents moves were repeated. Mine were not and each resulted in a new position. It was in the endgame and I was moving my king up to support a checkmate. I was given the option to accept a draw or cancel my move and no option to refuse the draw. This was certainly not a case of threefold repetition and a chess app that doesn't understand the rules of chess is useless.,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I am new to chess so I loose but still fun my tablet is older and laggy so slow play but I'm going to give the app the benefit of the doubt this tablet is laggy on other apps as well,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,This is a very simple app to navigate however the look needs to be updated.,3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"This isn't what I expected. Aside from the repetitive ads, doesn't mean completely useless, it's also upsetting because I can't even have a normal game just once. Why, I could even play multiple games with multiple players, but it's annoying that they barely makes a move and might continue the next and the next. It's frustrating and merely disappointing. I'm hoping for an unworthless and continuous game with one player.",1

Especially when playing Chesster (practice ""exhibition"" mode) in Expert mode - takes hours sometimes or I have to open and close the app several times.

When you allow other players to back track through the game or take unlimited time to make a move, you spoil the brainstorming advantages of both players. Even if both players have equal options.

You should do a checkers with friends as well.",1

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"The moves come in at pretty much real time and this is the only app that I found does that. Ads are pretty avoidable, but can get annoying. Unless you and your friend agree to finish a game immediately, don't expect back to back moves. It's more of a laid back chess game where you make your moves whenever you've got the time. Passive chess is a good way to think about it. I think the app should make a mode where each person has a timer like in real chess. That way you could play casually or play a real game",5

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Finished games with Chesster reappear often back to back may be a BUG. Playing with Chesster on expert takes a long time to think for next move. Please add option for two players locally (pass and play). Maybe be able to change the board type or color. It becoming boring after almost everyday use.,3

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Chess wise it's good I think. App wise it sort of lacks in some areas especially the part of not being able to upload a profile picture.. It pulls your profile pics from facebook which it seems they focused on. If you just sign up directly, you are cursed to have the stock missing profile picture icon. The other thing lacking is when players abandon a game on you, it counts down days implying that it will go away after 0. But what happens is an error that says ""moments ago left"" and stays forever there.",4

If someone makes a stupid mistake by putting their king into the line of fire, the game will not let them make that mistake.

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Who don't really care about chess.  They just eat to have some fun.,3

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"No time limits,  adds after moves!!!!  Srsly !!",1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,about as much as the average chess game. It is fairly easy to use and nice match up system.,3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"I've been enjoying playing chess with this app... including the chat feature and extract function.  Maybe they could improve the draw offer, which functions incorrectly: one should have to make a move before offering the draw, not vice versa.",5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Just love the opportunity of being able to beat up on your Facebook friends. Lol,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Can't  win 3 repetition,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,pls add time limit. opponents take  long time to play 1 move.,3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,For $1-5 lots of my friends would pay to remove the ads. $10 is too steep for as simple (though well done) an app as this.,3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Just hate the ads,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,okay,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Love playing with my buddies!,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Has MINOR glitches but nothing that impairs the game. Like if you make a move then exit an add and go back to fast your piece color will show as the enemy color until you leave and go back. No biggie. I plan on paying for the full version as soon as they have a sale. $10 is a bit steep for me.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Good,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Nice practice,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"I know ads are necessary, but 15 second un-skippaple auto-play ones with sound are not.",3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Corrupted Data,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"1. Background music is not necessary in my honest opinion. It gets boring and unpleasant real quick. 2. I really don't like waiting after I hit the confirm button on playing a turn. My internet is not spectacular, so it takes too much time to send the turn. Try to make it do that in the background, while I move on to the next game. 3. Add an analyze feature like in the chesstime app. 4. Thanks for reading :)",3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Ads tho......but easy to deal with,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Good and challenging,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,It's a very fun app. You Can Play Against So MANY people.,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Great chess app,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,It is a great deal like chess.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I like that i can play my friends but there is long lagtime trying to get to the active game when its your turn. Sometimes it doesnt respond at all or it will reflect  old moves 2 moves ago.   Other chess apps workbgreat but dont offer the play friends option.  Oh and lots of ads.,3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Good, solid game. Well done.",5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Awesome game keeps you in the moment.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,At least the adds are fun to play too haha,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,It's supper fun!,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,/\ that's all,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I like this app and let me enjoy my time when I'm playing with others just there are a lot of ads these are really annoying,3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Legit,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Too many ads,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Would be nice if the Chester practice games could be kept separate from your actual games,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I enjoy keeping in touch over a nice game of chess.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"A few people that spam to build their ratings that ruins the competition factor if you're really trying to see where you stand against the masses, but overall very good. You can play with people you know or new random people",4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Too many adds,2
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Best App I have.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Could lead to good conversation,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,It's still okay,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,This game does not play by international rules,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Awesome,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Works well but I would like to be able to view the game while without WiFi or data,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Ok,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Solid,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,The interface for playing games is smooth and easy to use. You can also review older games and save as pgn files which is useful. Gives you plenty of figures about the games that you and other players have won or lost. The major downside is that the app easily uses hundreds of Mb of data per month. A whole chess game is only a few kb so the majority of this is through full screen video adverts that come up every few moves. Add free version is very expensive.,3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Only thing I hate is the end of a game and player take there sweet time to make a play and to finish. Other then that I've really enjoyed it,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Love it,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,#greatgame,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Would be a great game if there weren't ads after every few moves. Gets annoying.,3

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Ok,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,The chat feature is great.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Very fun and addictive. Took no time at all to have my co-workers hooked,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I'm not a champion chess player but this format is easy enough to play,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Does what it is supposed to,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Would be nice to have optional  animation for kids.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,It has a couple minor glitches when sending moves to the opponent but even with that said it's a great app and I'm on it more than anything else on my phone!,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Only problem I have encountered is on the iOS version. It doesn't seem to have the same profile functions as the Android version. Other than that, excellent.",4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Great gane,4

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I play with my friends every day,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Good to play friends over a distance and time,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Love the rating system, great interface.  Play throughout the day at your own pace.  Perfect way to augment your day with some chess.",5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Its a great way to pass the time just wish there was less adds.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Easy to connect with friends.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Awesome app but the commercials are annoying,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Excellent game and very addictive. Keeps you sharp too,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Pay for the commercial-free version. Compelling propaganda is annoying. This android version is has retro feel as if its program is built upon an electronic chess platform from the 1980's at a time when atari graphics were high-tech. Way to go zynga.,3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I absolutely love this game,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I'm digging it.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Wish there was a training option for beginners. To teach how to explain check, check mate, and maybe strategy to start.",4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Worth the adds,5

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,it's definitely a good app!,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Awesome,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I play the game almost everyday,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Basic chess GUI. Not a whole lot of extras but they really aren't needed.,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,It's not too bad once you figure out how to quickly get out of the ads but they are a bit annoying. I should probably just pay for the premium version LOL.,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Waste to install,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I love this game. It is amazing.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,This app is so buggy. There isn't a way to turn off all the suggestions for games and it takes for ever for them to load. You also have to click on the players name 4 or 5 times to get it to load their game. The notifications won't go away unless you load from that notification. For example the stupid bubble that reminds you there is 1 move to make doesn't go away of you load it from the reminders section of the Android drop down menu.,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Too many ads..can't play continuously.,1
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Have been using for a few weeks now and it works well. Good variety of opponents and I like the groups.,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Awsome app.,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Wish the app have more time to gloat. Otherwise, great fun.",5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I love chess. It's relaxing and true to life.  This app is a ton of fun. I have had a good time playing here. My only improvement would be to know more about how the rating system works and questions on how long a person has to move before the game is resigned.  I can't find those answers. But other than that. Game on!!!,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"If you like chess, you'll hate this ultra slow version of the game!!!!!",1

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Challenging,5

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,It's good but the ads suck,3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"When I transferred my account to my new phone, my record of 129-50-16 was reset to 0-0-0 and all of my current games were erased. Also, my name was reset to a previous nick that I had on the game. It has been a while since I sent a help request to zynga and I have still not been contacted back about my problem. Please fix.

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I would rate this app higher but it wants way too much access to your phone and it keeps turning on the gps and running my phone battery down in the process.  Also the ranking system is flawed so that you see people cheating the system to get a high ranking.,3

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Ten bucks is too much,2
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I like being able to play against friends and family that are far away. The easy integration with Facebook is what drew me to the game. Would give an additional star for each of the folowing: 1. Ability to play on a windows laptop/pc. 2. Either fewer ads or a cheaper upgrade price. Ten bucks is a little steep for what is essentially a basic chess program.,3

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"The following features are really necessary for serious players.  1.The pgn button should provide a .pgn file, not just notations in text format.    2.Please give us options to play with other time controls like 1 day, 2 day etc. A 7 day game is kind of boring for most of the serious players.  3.You may think about implementing 'Conditional Move' feature to this app where a player will be able to enter some lines of play when he can predict his opponent's moves.",2

You choose the pace. You also get to see the opponent's rating before committing a game. Great free app.",5

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"As is typical with the app world, this think has way too many adds. Some games have a lot of adds, this game has a rediculous amount of adds popping up every move at some points. Other than the adds this is a fantastic chess app. I love it, I just can't stand to see 'game of war' pop up any more.",3
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Hours of fun minus the ads!!,5
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,The game said there was a stalemate when there clearly wasn't. I was denied the satisfaction of win. I'd give zero stars if I could.,1

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,"Fun game. I'm just a beginner, but it sorts you by a rating so you don't have to go up against pros. I give it 4 stars because it has some weird bugs that make you have to close it down and come back, like not showing the correct pieces. It's not a huge deal, but it can be annoying.",4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Totally recommend,5

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I want to give it 5 stars cuz it's the best chess app out there for turn based moving. But the game stopped giving me notifications when someone makes a move which is causing the games to last way too long. Please fix this so I can 5 star it!,2
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,10 bucks is pricey. But it's got a decent interface and definitely WAY better without advertisements.,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,However there should be a timer on this it's too slow,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,I find the ai quitting on me a lot,4
com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,The games needs a clock or timer per turn because it will take someone hours or a day before they move causing the games to take a week to finish when it should only take 30 minutes,3

com.zynga.chess.googleplay,A Google user,Works good for playing with a friend. But... It is not clear how to open app and open my current game. Not clear if how to play a computer. It is not clear how to play a 2 person game on one device.  It is not clear if the are parental controls or how to use them.   Would like to block people I don't know from challenging me or showering up on the list.  Would like to be able to block group names as many are not OK for my son. Overall the interface is not good.,3
